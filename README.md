# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Project
I am to prepare a report and analysis the "silver tsunami" as many current employees reach retirement age. There are two parts of the assignment. Determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to particpate in a mentorship program.

### Purpose
The purpose is to figure out how many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact, and are there enough qualified, retired-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees.

- [x] Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
- [x] Deliverable 2: The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program
- [x] Deliverable 3: A written report on the employee database analysis (README.md)
